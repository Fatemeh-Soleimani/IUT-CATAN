Catan  is a multiplayer board game. The base game of the Catan series, Catan, includes support for 3â€“4 players.  Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain points as their settlements grow; the first to reach a set number of points, typically 10, wins.
Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island.
Players build by spending resources (wood, stone , wheat, brick, and sheep ) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce stone, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.
There is also a robber token, initially placed on the desert; if a player rolls 7, the robber must be moved to another hex, which will no longer produce resources until the robber is moved again. That player may also steal a resource card from another player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new placement. In addition, when a 7 is rolled, all players with 8 or more resource cards must discard their choice of half of their cards, rounded down. For example, If a player has 9 resource cards, and a 7 is rolled, the player must get rid of 4 cards.

This project is programmed by C++ and QT creator  . 
to run this project you need to open .pro file of server and .pro file of catan  in QT .remember to run server because catan Won't be run without server . This project is programmed for 3 or 4 players so you should run catan.pro 3 or 4 times and then start your game :) 
in programming this app we use object oriented design . so you can see the codes of each class in separate branches for each of us and final version is on main branch.
This is our project for advanced programming lesson (AP) , and is coded by
 Fatemeh Soleimani(https://github.com/Fatemeh-Soleimani),
